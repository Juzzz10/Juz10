        <p>[Hello, I am Justine. I am a Currently a 3rd year student at University of the Assumption.]</p>

      I love grinding games with my friends specially after we've finished our works individually.
      I also love to spread Good Vibes. let's stop the negativity and embrace that life's good.I've always been hooked up to computers since I was a child. 
      And experienced different types of what u can do on it. And as long as you have a computer u can never be bored. That's the reason why I chose IT as my profession.
      I see myself exploring different types of jobs to have more experience and to be more efficient when it comes to making a project.
      I expect to have to learn the basics of being a software dev. My goal is to be a software developer someday and I want to know some decent knowledge about becoming like one.
      I want to learn more about JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, and Java. Because that's the most used language of a software dev.
